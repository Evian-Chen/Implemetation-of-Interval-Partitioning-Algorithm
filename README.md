# Implemetation-of-Interval-Partitioning-Algorithm

## Overview
This program randomly generates 1000 lectures to be managed into several classrooms.
The aim is to find the minimun number of the classrooms and arrange all the lectures
efficiently. Suppose the time range of every lecture is from 9:00 to 18:00, then there
are 18 time slots.

After all lectures are generated, this program will arrange all the lectures into several classrooms using greedy algorithm and output the result to a csv file. In the end, the csv file will be drawn as heatmap using pandas and matplotlib.
